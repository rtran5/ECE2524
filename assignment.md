The assignment I would make for future students taking Unix would be to use threads. 
The homework assignment would be 50 points. It would be pretty hard but I would
recommend giving the students some code that they would have to fill in. These type
of assignments are good when it's a first time trying to make a certain type of code.
It gives a nice starting point and since this concept could be higher, makes it a bit 
easier by offering some code. I would make it 10 points reading in the input files 
with the data that should be calculated. 15 points for outputting the correct output
and 15 points for doing the threading correctly. 5 for syntax and 5 for style. If the
project fails to run or compile I would base the grading on syntax and style first. 
Next I would check the code to see if they tried to attempt the inputting of the data
and threading.
